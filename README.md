# Circle of Truth

Circle of Truth brings you and your friends together like never before in a new, exciting game where you are able to ask burning questions and get answers. Simply choose a category and how many players to begin. The Circle will give you a person to ask a burning question to and then that person has to either answer the question truthfully within 20 seconds or they can choose to dodge the question. 

You can use the default “Friends” category to get started with unique icebreaker questions and even add your own questions to the mix. For a more customized friend group experience, choose the “Custom” category to create and save your own questions to ask your friends.
